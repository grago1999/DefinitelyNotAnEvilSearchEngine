# DefinitelyNotAnEvilSearchEngine
A purposely terrible search engine made for AIHacks at General Assembly. Only a few hours so the code itself is pretty rough around the edges. Note: Due to the use of Bing API there is a CORS issue, to see the suggestion bar either disable CORS on chrome (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome) or use Safari which has it disabled by default.
